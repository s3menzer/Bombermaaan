<h1>History of the Bombermaaan game project</h1>

<div id="content">

<p>
Thibaut Tollemer started this project in July 2000. 
He's been using this project as a demo of what he could do as a game programmer, in order to be hired.
As he was hired, he published the source code and created a project space on sourceforge.net on May 2003.
Unfortunately, he doesn't have so much time for programming new features since then.
</p>

<p>
Bernd Arnold joined the project in the end of 2007.
</p>

<p>
Jerome Bigot joined the project in May 2008. He developed the remote-fuse-bombs feature.
</p>

<p>
Markus Drescher joined the project in September 2008. He created the Linux port and is programming new features 
as well as enhancing the computer bombers' AI now.

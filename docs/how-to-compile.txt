These are the steps how to get Bombermaaan successfully compiled on Windows.

PLEASE NOTE: This how-to is incomplete so far!



- You need the Windows Platform SDK from Microsoft. I've read on another sf.net project site that this 
  isn't necessary if you have a full Visual C++ installation, not the Express Edition.
  Although the title says "Vista" I'm using this also on Win XP.
  1 GB download, ISO file

  According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK there is also the 
  possibility of a web installation so you don't need to burn a DVD.
  The installation takes some minutes.

- Get a C++ compiler. In this example, I'm using Microsofts Visual C++ Express Edition.

  Download web installer Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (vcsetup.exe):

  Run vcsetup.exe, the needed files will be downloaded by the installer (90 MB for me).

- Install service packs. For example for Visual C++ 2005 (!) Express Edition

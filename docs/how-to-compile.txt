These are the steps how to get Bombermaaan successfully compiled on Windows 32 bit.

PLEASE NOTE: This how-to is incomplete so far!



- You need the Windows Platform SDK from Microsoft. I've read on another sf.net project site that this 
  isn't necessary if you have a full Visual C++ installation, not the Express Edition.
  Although the title says "Vista" I'm using this on Win XP, too.
  1 GB download, ISO file

  According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK there is also the 
  possibility of a web installation so you don't need to burn a DVD.
  The installation takes some minutes.

- Get a C++ compiler. In this example, I'm using Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_Express#Visual_C.2B.2B_Express
  Download web installer Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (vcsetup.exe):
  http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729279
  Run vcsetup.exe, the necessary files will be downloaded by the installer (90 MB for me).

- Install service packs. For example for Visual C++ 2005 (!) Express Edition
  https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7b0b0339-613a-46e6-ab4d-080d4d4a8c4e&DisplayLang=en

- Download and install the DirectX SDK
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=86CF7FA2-E953-475C-ABDE-F016E4F7B61A&displaylang=en
  dxsdk_apr2007.exe, about 440 MB

- Download SDL development libraries
  http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
  SDL-devel-1.2.13-VC8.zip, about 607 kB (http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.13-VC8.zip)
  The VC8 file is also working for VC9
  Copy folder SDL-1.2.13 from the zip file to src folder
  Copy all DLL files from the lib subdirectory to the directory where Bombermaaan.exe resides (needing for runtime)
  
- Download SDL_mixer development libraries
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
  SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.8-VC8.zip, about 332 kB (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.8-VC8.zip)
  The VC8 file is also working for VC9
  Copy folder SDL_mixer-1.2.8 from the zip file to src folder
  Copy all DLL files from the lib subdirectory to the directory where Bombermaaan.exe resides (needing for runtime)

- Place afxres.h and winres.h in the Bombermaaan directory and in the resource directories RES and RES32. 
  You'll find these two files in a subdirectory of the installed Windows Platform SDK.
  I've found the files in this subdirectory:
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Samples\winui\tsfapp


>> The other steps will be added "soon".

These are the steps how to get Bombermaaan successfully compiled on Windows.

PLEASE NOTE: This how-to is incomplete so far!



- You need the Windows Platform SDK from Microsoft. I've read on another sf.net project site that this 
  isn't necessary if you have a full Visual C++ installation, not the Express Edition.
  Although the title says "Vista" I'm using this also on Win XP.
  1 GB download, ISO file
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=FF6467E6-5BBA-4BF5-B562-9199BE864D29&displaylang=en
  According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK there is also the 
  possibility of a web installation so you don't need to burn a DVD.
  The installation takes some minutes.

- Get a C++ compiler. In this example, I'm using Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_Express#Visual_C.2B.2B_Express
  Download web installer Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (vcsetup.exe):
  http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729279
  Run vcsetup.exe, the needed files will be downloaded by the installer (90 MB for me).

- Install service packs. For example for Visual C++ 2005 (!) Express Edition
  https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7b0b0339-613a-46e6-ab4d-080d4d4a8c4e&DisplayLang=en

- Download and install the DirectX SDK
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=86CF7FA2-E953-475C-ABDE-F016E4F7B61A&displaylang=en
  dxsdk_apr2007.exe, about 440 MB

- Download FMOD 3 Programmers API
  http://www.fmod.org/index.php/download
  fmodapi375win.zip, about 2 MB
  (FMOD Sound System, copyright (C) Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd., 1994-2007)

- Bombermaaan needs the following files from fmodapi375win.zip:
  fmod.h, fmod_errors.h from the fmodapi375win\api\inc folder, place them in the FMOD folder (needing to compile Bombermaaan)
  fmod.dll from the fmodapi375win\api folder, place it in the folder where Bombermaaan.exe resides (needing for runtime)

>> The other steps will be added soon.

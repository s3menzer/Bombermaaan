Release notes for Bombermaaan 1.4.0.655e
========================================

This is an EXPERIMENTAL release of Bombermaaan.

Bombermaaan web site: http://bombermaaan.sourceforge.net/

This release should (really!) fix the game crash in the winner screen 
and during the match when pressing a joystick's start button
as reported by Adam Jimenez on SourceForge.net.

There had to be at least two joysticks attached, otherwise the game didn't crash.

You can pause the game with the start button of your joystick now. On XBox controllers, 
the right thumbstick button pauses and unpauses the game.
If you start Bombermaaan with Bombermaaan_xbox.exe, the start button of your XBox controller
should pause and resume the game.

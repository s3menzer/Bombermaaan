<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a version of my (Thibaut's) Bomberman game project
which started on July 2000. I don't develop this
project in order to bring new concepts of gameplay
or to make the best Bomberman game ever but to
increase my programming skills and have a game
project I can show to be hired.

<h2>History</h2>

This program is still, and will always be under 
development. You can check the latest history of 
this project by browsing its website. You'll be 
informed of what was changed, fixed, added, and 
removed in each version.

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>
This program has been tested under Windows 95 OSR2,
98 PE/SE, 2000 and XP.
</p>

<p>
It requires DirectX 7.0 or later to run. It is
recommended you set your display to at least
16 bit color depth. A sound card is recommended.
</p>

               or punch a bomb that is right in front of you.

<h2>News</h2>

<p>
December 2007: We're putting the source files into sourceforge.net's subversion repository. This step isn't completed yet, so you won't find all the files there at the moment. Also we are writing a how-to guide you can use if you want to compile Bombermaaan on your own.

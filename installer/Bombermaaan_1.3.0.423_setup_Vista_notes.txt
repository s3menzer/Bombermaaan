Bombermaaan 1.3.0.423 - Installation notes for Vista
====================================================

When user access control (UAC) is turned on in Vista,
the Bombermaaan game may fail and cannot be played.

After starting the game (either the large window or
classic) by the shortcut in the start menu (or by directly
executing the program files, it doesn't matter), there
seems nothing to happen. No window opens.

Bombermaaan creates a log and a configuration file on
the first startup in its directory. With UAC enabled,
Vista doesn't allow this. Bombermaaan checks if the files
were created successfully. Since they aren't, Bombermaaan
exits without further notice.

To avoid this, you can install Bombermaaan in another directory,
not the %ProgramFiles% directory.
So try to install Bombermaaan in the "C:\Software\Bombermaaan 1.3\"
directory, for example. This folder is not protected by UAC,
so the files can be created successfully.

Of course this is on the roadmap to be changed in the future.

If you don't like installers, you are probably not touched by
this problem if download the zip package and unzip the file 
contents to your desktop or My Files folder.

Enjoy playing Bombermaaan!

Description: A Bomberman clone.
 .
 Bombermaaan is a classic bomberman game. Thibaut Tollemer started this 
 project on July 2000. He's been using this project as a demo of what he 
 could do as a game programmer, in order to be hired.
 .
 As he was hired, he published the source code and created a project 
 space on sourceforge.net on May 2003. Unfortunately, he doesn't have so 
 much time for programming new features now. Therefore, Bernd Arnold is 
 going to enhance Bombermaaan and develop new features in his spare 
 time. 
 He joined the project in the end of 2007.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a version of Thibaut's Bombermaaan game project
which started on July 2000. He didn't develop this
project in order to bring new concepts of gameplay
or to make the best Bomberman game ever but to
increase his programming skills and have a game
project he can show to be hired.

<h2>History</h2>

This program is still, and will always be under 
development. You can check the latest history of 
this project by browsing <a href="http://bombermaaan.sourceforge.net/">its website</a>. You'll be 
informed of what was changed, fixed, added, and 
removed in each version.

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>
This program has been tested under Windows 95 OSR2,
98 PE/SE, 2000 and XP. And Debian unstable on an i386 and an amd64 
machine.
</p>

<p>
It requires DirectX 7.0 or later to run. It is
recommended you set your display to at least
16 bit color depth. A sound card is recommended.
In Linux the SDL library as well as SDL_mixer 1.2.7 or higher is 
required.
</p>

<h2>Parameters and switches</h2>

<p>
When Bombermaaan is called without a command line parameter (started with mouse click for example),
the game fetches level files from the directory &lt;path-to-exe-file&gt;\Levels. The configuration
file named config.dat and log file named log.dat are read and/or written in the same folder where
the called exe file resides.
</p>

<p>
Since some Windows systems (Vista for example) don't allow the creation of files in the program's
directory, Bombermaaan was modified so the dynamic files (config.dat and log.dat) are handled
in a subfolder of the user's application data folder.<br />
You can use <kbd>echo %appdata%</kbd> in the command line to see where your application folder is
placed. Bombermaaan creates a subfolder called &quot;Bombermaaan&quot;. You can browse to this folder by
running <kbd>%appdata%\Bombermaaan</kbd> or typing <kbd>start &quot;%appdata%\Bombermaaan&quot;</kbd>
in a command line window.<br />
<strong>This behaviour is NOT enabled by default.</strong><br />
To enable the use of your %appdata% folder, append <kbd>--use-appdata-dir</kbd> when calling the
Bombermaaan exe file.<br />
Users can store their own level files in the %appdata%\Bombermaaan\Levels directory. These files
are also loaded as level files. So there is no need to touch the program files directory. Remember:
this behaviour is enabled when the <kbd>--use-appdata-dir</kbd> parameter is used.
</p>

<p>
You can call Bombermaaan with the <kbd>--help</kbd> switch to see a message box with
copyright and license notice.

May 2008: Released version 1.3.
</p>

<p>
December 2007: We're putting the source files into sourceforge.net's subversion repository. This step isn't completed yet, so you won't find all the files there at the moment. Also we are writing a how-to guide you can use if you want to compile Bombermaaan on your own.
